He was born in Switzerland and became a French citizen in 1930. His career spanned five decades, with his buildings constructed throughout Europe, India, and America. He was a pioneer in studies of modern high design and was dedicated to providing better living conditions for the residents of crowded cities. He was awarded the Frank P. Brown Medal and AIA Gold Medal in 1961.\r\nLe Corbusier adopted his pseudonym in the 1920s, allegedly deriving it in part from the name of an ancestor, Lecorbésier.\r\n\r\n### IDEAS\r\nFive points of architecture\r\nMain article: (Le Corbusier's Five Points of Architecture)\r\n![](http://www.militant-blog.org/wp-content/gallery/pittura-e-scultura/villa-savoye-le-corbusier.jpg)\r\nVilla Savoye\r\nIt was Le Corbusier's Villa Savoye (1929–31) that most succinctly summed up the five points of architecture that he had elucidated in L'Esprit Nouveau and the book Vers une architecture, which he had been developing throughout the 1920s. First, Le Corbusier lifted the bulk of the structure off the ground, supporting it by pilotis, reinforced concrete stilts. These pilotis, in providing the structural support for the house, allowed him to elucidate his next two points: a free facade, meaning non-supporting walls that could be designed as the architect wished, and an open floor plan, meaning that the floor space was free to be configured into rooms without concern for supporting walls. The second floor of the Villa Savoye includes long strips of ribbon windows that allow unencumbered views of the large surrounding yard, and which constitute the fourth point of his system. The fifth point was the roof garden to compensate for the green area consumed by the building and replacing it on the roof. A ramp rising from ground level to the third-floor roof terrace allows for an architectural promenade through the structure. The white tubular railing recalls the industrial \"ocean-liner\" aesthetic that Le Corbusier much admired. As if to put an exclamation mark after Le Corbusier's homage to modern industry, the driveway around the ground floor, with its semicircular path, measures the exact turning radius of a 1927 Citroën automobile.\r\n\r\n###Furniture\r\n\r\nMain article: Le Corbusier's Furniture\r\nCorbusier said: \"Chairs are architecture, sofas are bourgeois\".\r\n\r\nLe Corbusier began experimenting with furniture design in 1928 after inviting the architect, Charlotte Perriand, to join his studio. His cousin, Pierre Jeanneret, also collaborated on many of the designs. Before the arrival of Perriand, Le Corbusier relied on ready-made furniture to furnish his projects, such as the simple pieces manufactured by Thonet, the company that manufactured his designs in the 1930s.\r\nIn 1928, Le Corbusier and Perriand began to put the expectations for furniture Le Corbusier outlined in his 1925 book L'Art Décoratif d'aujourd'hui into practice. In the book he defined three different furniture types: type-needs, type-furniture, and human-limb objects. He defined human-limb objects as: \"Extensions of our limbs and adapted to human functions that are type-needs and type-functions, therefore type-objects and type-furniture. The human-limb object is a docile servant. A good servant is discreet and self-effacing in order to leave his master free. Certainly, works of art are tools, beautiful tools. And long live the good taste manifested by choice, subtlety, proportion, and harmony\".\r\nThe first results of the collaboration were three chrome-plated tubular steel chairs designed for two of his projects, The Maison la Roche in Paris and a pavilion for Barbara and Henry Church. The line of furniture was expanded for Le Corbusier's 1929 Salon d'Automne installation, 'Equipment for the Home'.\r\nThese chairs included the LC-1, LC-2, LC-3, and LC-4, originally titled \"Basculant\" (LC-1), \"Fauteuil grand confort, petit modèle\" (LC-2, \"great comfort sofa, small model\"), \"Fauteuil grand confort, grand modèle\" (LC-3, \"great comfort sofa, large model\"), and \"Chaise longue\" (LC-4, \"Long chair\").[11] The LC-2 and LC-3 are more colloquially referred to as the petit confort and grand confort (abbreviation of full title, and due to respective sizes). The LC-2 (and similar LC-3) have been featured in a variety of media, notably the Maxell \"blown away\" advertisement.[12]\r\nIn the year 1964, while Le Corbusier was still alive, Cassina S.p.A. of Milan acquired the exclusive worldwide rights to manufacture his furniture designs. Today many copies exist, but Cassina is still the only manufacturer authorized by the Fondation Le Corbusier; see US page.\r\n\r\nLet's Have a look at some pieces of furniture created by Le Corbusier\r\n\r\n##LC17 Portemanteau\r\n![](http://static1.bonluxat.com/cmsense/data/uploads/orig/le-corbusier-lc17-coat-stand_uuql.jpg)\r\nA coat stand in oak with matte black back and solid oak knobs in matte white, black, red, green and blue.\r\n##Spazio PER PLASM\r\n\r\n##LC11\r\n![](http://www.forza.co.uk/images/sized/images/gallery/products/design_classics/le_corbusier/LC11-P_355-355x355.jpg)\r\nTable with grey enamelled steel structure and cast iron base.

His writings were strewn with references to autos: \"If houses were built industrially, mass-produced like chassis, an aesthetic would be formed with surprising precision,\" he wrote in Toward an Architecture (1923). In his \"white phase\" of the twenties and thirties, he insisted that his buildings be photographed with a modern automobile in the foreground. Le Corbusier moved beyond the theoretical in 1936, entering (with his cousin Pierre Jeanneret) an automobile design competition, submitting plans for \"a minimalist vehicle for maximum functionality,\" the Voiture Minimum. Despite Le Corbusier’s energetic promotion of his design to several important automakers, the Voiture Minimum was never mass-produced.\r\n\r\n##Let's have a look at \"Voiture Minimum\"\r\n![](http://news.beloblog.com/ProJo_Blogs/architecturehereandthere/corbvoituremin.jpg)\r\n![](http://static.dezeen.com/uploads/2012/03/dezeen_Design-Museum-Collection-app-driving-movies-11.jpg)\r\n##Spazio PER PLASM\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n###And finally, if we would see all in a house...\r\n##Spazio PER PLASM\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\n@V1LL0, thanks to ALberto Paoluzzi, Enrico Marino and Federico Spini","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
